"""Backend for the Pakon scanning application (Electron front end).

Storage contract, from the owner's product rules:

  * One image per frame. Frames are rendered from (capture + parameters) on
    demand. There are no ``frame_03_v2.png`` intermediates anywhere.
  * Export is the only act that writes files the user keeps.
  * Everything else lives in a temp workspace, deleted on close. On startup we
    offer to clean up leftovers, showing scan count, dates and total size.
  * But creative work is never lost. The capture is bulk and regenerable; the
    per-frame parameters are tiny and are the actual work, so they are written
    to sidecars *outside* the workspace, keyed by capture identity, and
    restored when the same capture is reopened.

Relationship to ``tools/pakon_ui.py``: that file belongs to the colour task
and is its decode backend. This one **subclasses its request handler**, so
every endpoint it serves keeps working unchanged on the same port and this
module only adds ``/api/app/*``. Nothing in pakon_ui.py is edited or replaced.
If the import fails (it is under active development) we degrade to serving
only our own routes rather than failing to start.

#: This used to be ``_ROOT / "captures"``, which was wrong twice.
#:
#: It broke the storage contract at the top of this file. "Everything else
#: lives in a temp workspace, deleted on close" is the owner's rule, and the
#: primary artefact of the main path was the one thing exempt from it: purge()
#: only ever walked WORKSPACE, so captures accumulated forever while two
#: dialogs told the user they had been deleted.
#:
#: And when packaged, ``_ROOT`` is ``process.resourcesPath`` — inside the
#: signed .app bundle. A scan would ``mkdir`` and write 700 MB into
#: ``Pakon Mac.app/Contents/Resources/captures``, which breaks the signature
#: and puts the owner's photographs somewhere an app update deletes.

#: So captures live in the cache tree beside the workspace, and purge() reaches

    count. A 3-channel line is 6000 words; a 4-channel (IR) line is 8000.

    IR is untested on this unit — the hardware supports it (Current_Ir = 4,
    DutyCycle_Ir = 0.887) but no IR capture exists yet, so this reports what
    it finds rather than promising the pipeline can use it.

    Two separate answers, because they stopped being the same question when
    the decoder learned 8000-word lines (docs/70):

      ``unpackable``  ``pakon_decode`` can sync-segment and unpack this
                      geometry into planes. True for 6000 and 8000.
      ``decodable``   the *rendering* path can make a picture out of it. Still
                      3-channel only: ``rgb14.npy``, the committed
                      ``dark_2000x3``/``gain_2000x3`` tables and the Go TIFF
                      hand-off are all RGB, and there is no infrared dark or
                      gain reference in ``calibration/`` to flat-field a fourth
                      plane with. A 4-channel capture is therefore recognised

# scanning — supervising a process that can move the owner's film
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The backend deliberately never opens the scanner to run a scan. It starts
# `pakon_scan.py run` as a child and talks to it over pipes, for one reason:
# if a process holding the USB interface is killed, nothing it intended to do
# in a `finally` happens, and the transport keeps running. Keeping the handle
# in a separate, disposable process means the interface is free the moment
# that process dies, and this one can then stop the machine itself.
#
# Cancel is the closing of the child's stdin, not a signal. A closed pipe
# reaches the child even if this process is SIGKILLed, so the same mechanism
# covers "the user pressed Cancel" and "the app was force-quit".

#: The cross-process interlock, which had a writer and a reader but no refusal.
#:
#: ``pakon_scan`` has always written ``~/.pakon-scan-in-flight.json`` while a
#: scan is in flight, and ``probe()`` has always reported ``in_flight``. But
#: nothing ever refused on it, and ``ScanSupervisor``'s own guard is a lock
#: object in *this* interpreter's memory — it says nothing about a second
#: backend. That second backend is reachable: force-quit the window mid-scan
#: and the backend outlives it with its scan child still driving the transport;
#: relaunch, and a fresh backend starts, sees its own supervisor idle, and
#: opens the device.
#:
#: What happens then, on macOS, is worse than a refusal. libusb's darwin
#: backend opens the *device* with ``USBDeviceOpenSeize`` and, per its own
#: source, ignores ``kIOReturnExclusiveAccess`` there and carries on;
#: ``set_configuration`` is then a device-wide IOKit ``SetConfiguration``,
#: which — again per libusb's own comment, "setting configuration will
#: invalidate the interface" — tears down the interfaces of every client,
#: including the one streaming EP 0x86. ``Link.open`` swallows that USBError.
#: Only the ``claim_interface`` that follows is genuinely refused
#: (``USBInterfaceOpen`` → ``kIOReturnExclusiveAccess`` →
#: ``LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS``), and by then the damage is done. The kernel's
#: exclusion is real but it arrives one call too late to be an interlock, so
#: the interlock has to be ours and it has to be consulted before we open
#: anything at all.

    THE GUARDS, IN ORDER, AND WHY EACH ONE IS HERE
    ----------------------------------------------
    1. ``SCAN.running()`` -- a calibration needs the USB interface to itself.
    2. ``foreign_scan()`` -- so does another process's scan.
    3. one calibration at a time -- two searches driving the same lamp would
       each measure the other's setting.
    4. already calibrated -- refuses unless the caller explicitly asks again.
       The existing set is kept regardless; nothing here deletes.

    What it does NOT guard is "is there film in the gate", because that is not
    a question this layer can answer and not a question a person should be
    asked. The wizard measures it -- see calib_wizard's docstring for why the
    film sensors and the gate classifier are not symmetric signals -- and comes
    back in the ``film-in-gate`` state, which is one sentence on screen and no
    control.

    The job is minted here, AFTER every guard passes, not by the caller ahead
    of time. It used to be the other way around (``S.job_new`` called by the
    route handler before this function ran at all): that job existed in
    ``S.jobs`` with ``status="running"`` from the moment it was created, so
    guard 3's own busy-scan always found it -- ITSELF -- and refused every
    single call, including the very first one on a freshly-started backend
    (confirmed live: a bare ``POST /api/app/calibration/run`` against a
    process that had never run a calibration still came back 409 "A
    calibration is already running."). Worse, a refusal from guard 1, 2 or 4
    left that phantom "running" job in ``S.jobs`` forever -- nothing ever
    marked it done or errored -- so it also permanently blocked every later
    call for the rest of the process's life, not just the one that tripped
    it. Not minting the id until a real job is actually about to start closes
