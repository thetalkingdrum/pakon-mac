/*
 * hookcore_real_table.c -- the REAL 23-address PSI.exe hook table.
 *
 * This is a byte-for-byte transcription of `HOOKS` in `../agent.js` (the
 * prior Frida version) -- same 23 addresses, same ids, same dll names,
 * same citations, in the same order (so `HookCore_BuildRealTable`'s
 * implicit index assignment 0..22 for entryThunk = Thunk_00..Thunk_22
 * lines up 1:1 with agent.js's own HOOKS array position). Per the task
 * this was built for: "reuse that exact address list and citations,
 * don't re-derive from scratch" -- nothing below was re-derived; every
 * `va`/`cite` field is copied from agent.js verbatim.
 *
 * `check_table_sync.py` in this same directory automatically parses both
 * this file and agent.js and diffs their (dll, va, id) triples, so this
 * claim is mechanically checked, not just asserted in a comment.
 *
 * exitDefault: 1 for every confirmed-address hook (entry+exit attempted
 * by default), except the two `approximate: true` entries below, which
 * are DISABLED entirely by default (see HookCore_LoadConfig) regardless
 * of exitDefault, until verified live -- exitDefault is still set
 * honestly for them (matching the others) so enabling them via hooks.cfg
 * gets sensible behavior without a second edit.
 *
 * One extra runtime note not in agent.js: `tla_colneg_mmx_kernel` (index
 * 19) is described in agent.js's own citation as "the inner MMX kernel
 * itself" -- if that runs per-scanline or per-pixel-block rather than
 * once per frame, entry+exit hooking it live could be high-frequency
 * (large log volume, measurable slowdown). It defaults to exit-enabled
 * here like everything else, but hooks.cfg lets you turn it off
 * (`tla_colneg_mmx_kernel.exit=off` or `tla_colneg_mmx_kernel=off`
 * entirely) without a rebuild if a first live run shows it's too hot --
 * see README.md.
 *
 * hotPathDisabled (added after docs/74 SS32's real disassembly of
 * `tlb_polypixel`/0x1000d880): a second, DISTINCT reason a confirmed-real
 * hook can default to off, separate from `approximate`. `approximate`
 * means "this address was never independently re-confirmed as a real
 * function entry" -- `hotPathDisabled` means the opposite (the address IS
 * confirmed real, by direct disassembly) but the hook is still off by
 * default because it's a demonstrated per-pixel/per-scanline hot path AND
 * its original live-capture purpose has since been fully resolved
 * statically, leaving nothing left for a live trace to answer. Currently
 * only `tlb_polypixel` sets this -- see its own citation below for the
 * full reasoning, and hookcore.h for the field's contract.
 *
 * notCallReachable (added 2026-08-15, root-causing the "stops mid-loop
 * under load, no shutdown message" failure that persisted across two real
 * XP-box captures -- `live_hooks_20260814-110254.jsonl` (clean shutdown)
 * and `live_hooks_20260814-112642.jsonl` (no shutdown message) -- even
 * AFTER the FlushFileBuffers-on-every-line fix): a THIRD, separate reason,
 * found by re-running `r2 -c 'aaa; af @ <va>; axt @ <va>'` against the
 * MD5/sha256-verified vendor DLLs fresh (PakonIMAu.dll sha256
 * 0ede8d9813af4ee95dddd85e5adc495a27f014a8fd4817cfbc3b3b1e107f511f per
 * reachability.py; TLA.dll md5 33f7a247d79286a31b192e83d3c37425 and TLB.dll
 * md5 193d9b2ce0a4b77ae9b78262bd06c0fc, both freshly extracted from the
 * SAME `research/sdk/PAKONF135.iso` this pass -- not independently cited
 * anywhere before this, but same verified ISO every other MD5 in this repo
 * traces back to). Five of the (non-approximate) addresses in this table
 * turned out to NOT be independently call-reachable function entries at
 * all: `af` analysis starting from the documented VA walked back to an
 * earlier, different, real function entry, and `axt` found only CODE-type
 * (jmp/jcc) cross-references from within that enclosing function, never a
 * CALL-type one. Hooking such an address with this engine's
 * calling-convention-agnostic return-address-swap technique (hookstub.S)
 * is unsafe for a reason distinct from both `approximate` (uncertain
 * citation) and `hotPathDisabled` (certain but too hot to be worth it):
 * the engine's one hard precondition -- "the DWORD at [esp] when a hooked
 * address is reached is always a real return address, because the only way
 * to reach it is via `call`" -- is simply false for these five. Reached via
 * an internal jmp/jcc instead, [esp] holds whatever real local variable or
 * spilled register the ACTUAL enclosing function happened to put there,
 * and this engine's entry stub corrupts it by overwriting it with
 * `OnReturnThunk`'s address. `sba_set_shifts_12` (see its own citation) has
 * DIRECT LIVE EVIDENCE of exactly this happening, 3 times across the two
 * new captures, every single time via the identical mechanism. Disabled by
 * default regardless of `approximate`/`hotPathDisabled` -- see
 * hookcore.h's own comment on this field for why re-enabling any of these
 * five specific VAs is never correct (unlike `approximate`, there is
 * nothing to "verify live" that would turn this back on; a genuinely new,
 * independently call-reachable address for the underlying subsystem would
 * need to be re-derived first). A SEPARATE, general engine-level guard
 * (`LooksLikeCodeAddress` in hookcore.c, checked before every
 * return-address swap) was added the same pass specifically so a hook NOT
 * yet known to have this problem -- including any of the 5 TLA.dll/PakonIMAu.dll
 * hooks below with zero resolvable r2 xrefs at all (`icc_effect_op`,
 * `tla_baddscene`'s siblings' own callers, etc. -- indirect/vtable calls
 * this static pass could not resolve either way) -- can't cause the same
 * corruption; per-address disabling below is the confirmed-bad list, not
 * the complete guarantee.

         * HISTORY, because the correction matters more than the result. The
         * pass that first wrote these three rows shipped them approximate=1
         * on two stated premises, and BOTH WERE FALSE:
         *
         * (1) "TLB.dll is not on this machine." It is, and always was, at
         * /tmp/pakon_re/TLB.dll -- which is precisely the scratch directory
         * CLAUDE.md designates for RE work, and the FIRST of the two paths
         * pakon_framing_golden.py's own DEFAULT_DLL_CANDIDATES already
         * searches. md5 193d9b2ce0a4b77ae9b78262bd06c0fc, matching the hash
         * that harness expects. The `find` behind the claim was scoped to
         * the repo, and `mdfind` does not index /tmp. The lesson is the one
         * docs/74 SS178.1 already drew about the truncated capture: an
         * absence of evidence has to be verified as carefully as a presence,
         * and "I could not find X" is a claim about the search, not about X.
         *
         * (2) "The `or` sites span a range containing 0x100072c0, so the
         * entry may be interior to fcn.10006e70." Resolved by reading it:
         * fcn.10006e70 is 0x10006e70-0x100072b5 and fcn.100072c0 is
         * 0x100072c0-0x100079b1. They are ADJACENT, with 11 bytes of
         * padding, not nested. Three of the four `or` sites (0x1000708b,
         * 0x10007193, 0x1000729f) are inside the driver; the fourth
         * (0x10007d35) is in fcn.100079c0, the outer caller. Nothing spans
         * anything. The feared repeat of `sba_set_shifts_12` / v41's
         * 0x100fe4f0 is not present here.
         *
         * All three are now approximate=0, each row citing its own `afi`
         * extents and its prologue's patch safety. The dump sizes were
         * checked rather than assumed: the highest this-relative offset the
         * entry touches is esi+0x6cbc, ending at 0x6cbf, so 0x6CC0 is exact.
         *
         * tlb_framing_line_reduce stays OFF by default via hotPathDisabled,
         * for its per-line log volume ALONE -- see its citation; that is a
         * cost decision, and the only one of the three that is. */

         * packer over 24,771 dwords.
         *
         * WHY THIS HOOK EXISTS: both of those ports are tier 1 for
         * EQUIVALENCE and tier 4 for PROVENANCE. No capture in the tree hooks
         * either function, so their inputs are synthetic. That settles "does
         * this arithmetic match" and does NOT settle "are these the values a
         * real frame produces" -- and B1 is precisely a question about real
         * per-frame values. This row is what converts it.
         *
         * The caller sba_order_fpo_calc (0x1028b8d0) is already hooked, but it
         * is the CALLER: docs/74 SS192.1 corrected an earlier reading that
         * named it the producer. It is 2,958 B; this is 24,516 B.
         *
         * ONE entry+exit pair on the object covers everything, because
         * fcn.102b7440 writes into the SAME object before this function
         * returns. Measured written extents are +0x6..+0x1c, +0x3c..+0xb7c
         * and +0xc20..+0xf80, so a 0x1000 dump from the base covers all three
         * with nothing assumed about where any of them starts. The ENTRY side
         * is not redundant: SS196 confirmed the cross-call read of [obj+0x7b8]
         * (vector slot 479) at 0x102b0da5 is LIVE, reached from the
         * 0x102b0e75 arm, so a later invocation consumes what an earlier one
         * wrote and only an entry dump shows what it read.
         *
         * Safety: prologue is a single 6-byte `sub esp, 0xfac`, so MinHook's
         * 5-byte patch cannot split an instruction, and `axt` finds no jump
         * target at +1..+4. Re-derived 2026-08-21 against PakonIMAu.dll md5

         * float 14-bit non-inverted data, and the 14->8 quantisation the vendor

         * AND the finished 8-bit summary from the SAME real frame; the per-line
         * value-writer itself is on an unhookable DMA path (prior RE), so the
         * plan is to capture (16-bit source image + 8-bit summary + geometry)
         * and derive the map offline.
         *
         * fcn.10004f00 is the framing object's allocator/geometry site
         * (__thiscall, ecx = the object). It computes count = total_lines /

         * capture turns on: +0x60 (a POINTER to a row-pointer table; the
         * contiguous 16-bit CCD base is table[0], a DOUBLE deref), +0x64 (size),
         * +0x6c (the 8-bit summary). One entry+exit pair here records the object
         * header after those stores; the two new +0x60 dump rows on
         * tlb_framing_line_reduce read the 16-bit image and the row table.

     *
     * The question: SS72.3 proved this function's own top level writes only
     * pref_data+0x3e on the live-firing case, NOT the orderFpo Y/U/V triple
     * at pref_data+0x0/+0x2/+0x4. Either one of its 8 unread helpers writes
     * that triple (pref_data threaded in as a hidden arg), or something else
     * entirely does. This capture answers it empirically.
     *
     * WHY ENTRY-ONLY IS SUFFICIENT (a real deviation from SS72.7's own
     * proposed spec, made deliberately, not by oversight): LogExtraDumps is
     * called ONLY from HookEntryC (hookcore.c ~line 645), never from the
     * exit path -- extra dumps physically cannot fire on return with this
     * engine as built, and adding that would be a real engine change with
     * its own risk (at exit the args have been popped; sp no longer points
     * at a valid arg frame). It is not needed: this function is called 5x
     * per frame with the SAME pref_data pointer (arg 12, both call sites,
     * SS72.2), so consecutive ENTRY dumps give before/after across calls
     * 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->5 directly, and the state AFTER the 5th call is
     * already captured by the existing `sba_preference`/`pref_data` row
     * above -- SS72.5 proved 0x1028b8d0's calls all precede Preference's own
     * single call in the same per-frame pass. Five entry dumps plus one
     * existing Preference dump = six observations of the same 0x64-byte blob
     * spanning all five calls, which is exactly the before/after series the
     * question needs.
     *
     * WHY NO 13 RAW-ARG ROWS (SS72.7 proposed 13x EXTRA_DUMP_STACK_PTR):
     * they would be redundant AND wrong-shaped. The engine already logs the
     * first STACK_DWORDS_LOGGED (=16, hookcore.c line 52) raw stack dwords on
     * every entry, and this function takes 13 args -- so all 13 raw arg
     * VALUES are captured for free in the existing "stack_dwords" field.
     * EXTRA_DUMP_STACK_PTR would instead DEREFERENCE each one, which is not
     * what SS72.7 wanted from those rows. Keeping them out also keeps this a
     * cheap addition on the real box.
     *
     * IMPORTANT -- this dump self-checks SS72.2's own arg table rather than
     * trusting it: SS72.2 rates its 13-arg mapping Tier 3 (static, cross-
     * checked two ways, NOT live-confirmed). If arg 12 is not really
     * scene+0x38a2, pref_data_before dumps something else and the mismatch is
     * itself the finding -- and the raw stack_dwords in the same JSONL line
     * give the ground truth to re-derive the real mapping from. Nothing here
     * assumes SS72.2 is right.
     *
     * arg 5 (the DPI-blob-copy-or-zero input SS72.4 traced) and arg 11
     * (fosDmin, scene+0x290c) are dumped too: SS72.4 found arg 5 has TWO
     * different provenances at the two call sites (a copy of the same
     * DPI-static blob Preference reads, vs explicitly zeroed), and which one
     * a real frame uses is one of the three unknowns SS72.6 named as
     * blocking a Unicorn harness. Dumping it settles that from real data. */

     * =================================================================
     *
     * Everything above this line captures ONE question at a time: a row was
     * added, a scan was run, a section of docs/74 was written, and the next
     * pass added another row. What has never existed is a capture that
     * records the vendor's own state at EVERY stage boundary ON THE SAME
     * FRAMES, which is what turns "this stage matches on synthetic input"
     * into "this stage matches the vendor, on the vendor's own data, at both
     * its input and its output". These rows are that trace.
     *
     * THE SCENE STRUCT -- derived this pass, af+pdf, cross-checked three ways
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     * PakonIMAu.dll md5 eea9dcf78ee21d4f7c515a6c2512242d (the same copy every
     * docs/74 section cites), r2 `af`+`pdf` from the real function entries.
     *
     * fcn.10069490 (cn_enhanced_driver) is `push ebp; mov ebp,esp` and does
     * `mov esi, [ebp+0xc]` at 0x100694cc -- so ESI, the register every
     * per-frame stage's arguments are built from, is the SECOND argument,
     * i.e. **stack_dwords[1]**. Reading its call sites gives the arguments of
     * every stage below directly, which is worth far more than re-deriving
     * each callee's prologue (the arithmetic this project has got wrong in
     * v22, v24 and v26, once per hardware round trip):
     *
     *   0x100697d9  fugc_analyze         push esi | esi+4 | holder | &status
     *   0x10069837  balance_area_image   push esi+0x4ac | b[esi+0x29] | holder | &status
     *   0x1006988a  analyze_area         push &loc | [esi+0x30] | b[esi+0x4c] |
     *                                         b[esi+0x29] | esi+0x4b6 | 1 |
     *                                         holder | &status
     *   0x100698e4  analyze_attributes   push esi | esi+4 | holder | &status
     *   0x100699a3  analyze_falloff      push esi | edi | holder | &status
     *   0x100699eb  analyze_auto_tone    push esi | edi | holder | &status
     *   0x100694cf  analyze_post_balance push [esi+0x2c] | esi+4 | esi+0x4ac |
     *                                         holder | &status
     *
     * pushes are right-to-left, so the LAST push is stack_dwords[0]. The
     * `holder` slot is the small object fcn.10006880 constructs in place
     * (`mov ecx,esp` then `call 0x10006880`, which is `ret 4`).
     *
     * THREE INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATIONS that ESI is the scene and the scene is
     * 0x64DC bytes:
     *   1. docs/74 SS95 recorded cn_enhanced_driver's live pointer values --
     *      150139080, 150164900, 150190720 -- whose stride is exactly 25820
     *      = 0x64DC.
     *   2. fcn.100fb730 (analyze_auto_tone) does `mov eax,[ebp+0x14]` (arg 4)
     *      then `mov [eax+0x64d0], edi` at 0x100fb787 -- a write to the LAST
     *      dword of a 0x64DC struct, and arg 4 is ESI per the call site above.
     *      It is the only >=3-digit structure offset in that whole 5,695-byte
     *      function.
     *   3. The already-live, already-proven `balance_shift_4b6` row reads
     *      arg index 3 + 0x0a on balance_area_image; the call site shows
     *      index 3 == esi+0x4ac, so that row reads esi+0x4b6 -- which is what
     *      SS105 named it after. An independent derivation landing on an
     *      existing row's known-good address is the check that matters.
     *
     * So `stack_dwords[1]` at cn_enhanced_driver and `stack_dwords[3]` at
     * fugc/falloff/auto_tone/attributes are the SAME 0x64DC object, and a
     * 0x64DC dump captures exactly one scene without reading into the next
     * (they are contiguous). Every narrow per-frame row above -- +0x4b6,
     * +0x3a38, +0x3a30, +0x5074, +0x38a2, +0x290c, +0x64d0 -- lives inside
     * it, so these rows SUBSUME them and, on the same capture, must AGREE
     * with them. check_v46.py tests exactly that, and a disagreement means
     * this derivation is wrong rather than that the vendor changed.
     *
     * WHY WHOLE-SCENE AND NOT NARROW ROWS AT KNOWN OFFSETS. Because the
     * open question (SS168, SS180, SS185: what produces the per-frame delta)
     * is "which field changed during this stage", and a narrow row can only
     * answer it for fields already suspected. An entry/exit pair of the whole
     * struct answers it for every field at once, and it is CHEAP: 0x64DC is
     * 25,820 bytes, ~52 KB hex-encoded, so all 39 frames at both ends of the
     * driver cost ~4 MB. The expensive rows in this table are the pixel
     * planes, which are half a megabyte each; the scalars are free by
     * comparison, which is why none of the rows below are capped.

     *   - `measure_obj` at idx 10 resolved to 0x08dc60b0, which WAS readable
     *     and did contain plausible mask-shaped and vector-shaped data. It
     *     was simply a different, nearby object. The tell was that
     *     measure_obj_pre and measure_obj_post were byte-identical on all 18
     *     calls while `scene_in`/`scene_out` differed on 6 of 6 — i.e. the
     *     exit mechanism worked fine and the thing being dumped genuinely
     *     never changed, because sba_measure does not write it.
     *   - the real object is `esi` (docs/74 SS192: arg10 == esi), and the
     *     capture shows esi == 0x08dc89bc == stack_dwords[**9**].
     *
     * The lesson is the same one as the framing +0x6c pointer, from the other
     * side: a readable dump full of plausible-looking bytes is not evidence
     * that the address was right. `unreadable` is a gift; silent plausibility
     * is the dangerous case, and only a cross-check — here, "did the buffer
     * this function is documented to write actually change?" — catches it. */
