/*
 * hookcore.h -- shared entry/exit hook engine used by both hookdll.c (the
 * real 23-address PSI.exe/PakonIMAu.dll/TLA.dll/TLB.dll harness) and
 * selftest.c (a synthetic self-test run under Wine on the dev machine,
 * see win_inject/README build notes).
 *
 * WHY A GENERIC, CALLING-CONVENTION-AGNOSTIC ENGINE
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * `agent.js`'s own header comment (the prior Frida version this ports)
 * says plainly: "It does not know the exact calling convention (register
 * vs. stack, exact arg index) for any of these functions at the assembly
 * level -- that was never re-derived from a live disassembly for this
 * task". That fact is still true here. MinHook's documented, normal usage
 * pattern is a typed C detour matching the target's real signature -- but
 * writing 23 typed detours would mean inventing 23 unconfirmed signatures,
 * exactly what this project's own rules forbid ("no invented addresses...
 * if unsure, say so honestly rather than guessing").
 *
 * So instead, every hook here uses ONE shared, hand-written x86 asm
 * entry stub (`hookstub.S`) that:
 *   1. Saves every general register + EFLAGS (a plain `pushfd; pushad`),
 *      so entry logging is a raw register/stack dump, identical in spirit
 *      to what agent.js's `regsToObj()`/`pointer_scan()` already did --
 *      never assuming which register/stack slot is "the" pixel buffer.
 *   2. Passes that raw state to `HookEntryC()` (below) for logging, then
 *      restores every register to its EXACT original value and tail-jumps
 *      (`jmp`, not `call`) into MinHook's trampoline for that hook -- so
 *      the original function executes with a byte-for-byte identical
 *      register/stack state to an un-hooked call. This works for cdecl,
 *      stdcall, thiscall, AND fastcall alike, because none of those
 *      Windows x86 conventions change where the return address lives (always
 *      the first thing on the stack at function entry) or what "restore
 *      every register + flags" means.
 *   3. For exit logging: rather than a `call` into the trampoline (which
 *      would push an extra return address and shift every stack-passed
 *      argument by 4 bytes relative to what the target's own prologue
 *      expects -- silently wrong for any function with stack args, on
 *      literally every convention except a zero-arg one), this uses the
 *      standard convention-agnostic "return address swap" technique: the
 *      real return address (to the ACTUAL caller) is saved on a per-thread
 *      shadow stack, and the stack slot is overwritten with the address of
 *      `OnReturnThunk`. When the hooked function eventually executes its
 *      own `ret`/`ret N` (which pops exactly one return address, however
 *      many bytes of arguments it additionally frees, on every one of
 *      these conventions), control lands in `OnReturnThunk` instead of the
 *      real caller, with the return value already sitting in EAX (and EDX
 *      for 64-bit returns) per the one universal x86-on-Windows rule that
 *      *is* convention-independent. `OnReturnThunk` logs, then tail-jumps
 *      to the real saved return address, so the real caller never knows
 *      any of this happened.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ASSUMES (the ONE real assumption, stated honestly, not hidden)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The shared entry stub uses EAX as scratch for the final trampoline-jump
 * target immediately before entering the target's relocated prologue. On
 * every standard Windows x86 calling convention (cdecl, stdcall, thiscall,
 * fastcall), EAX never carries an incoming argument (fastcall's first two
 * args go in ECX/EDX; EAX is return-value-only) -- so this is safe for any
 * compiler-generated function using one of those four conventions, which
 * is true of essentially all MSVC-compiled C/C++ of this era (the vendor
 * DLLs; docs/62 already identifies several of these as C++ methods, e.g.
 * `ColorNegativePath::analyzeAutoTone`, `AnsAreaCapabilityImpl::
 * applyBalanceShifts`). It would NOT be safe for genuinely custom/
 * register-passing ABIs (unlikely for MSVC C++ output, but not something
 * that has been independently re-verified per-function from a live
 * disassembly -- flagged honestly here, not assumed silently).
 *
 * A SECOND, SEPARATE CAVEAT: if a hooked function's stack unwinds via a
 * C++ exception or SEH instead of a normal `ret` (e.g. the function or
 * something it calls throws), `OnReturnThunk` is never reached, and the
 * corresponding shadow-stack slot is never popped -- not a memory-safety
 * bug (nothing is ever jumped to based on a stale slot), but it does mean
 * that call's exit never gets logged, and in a worst case a later call at
 * the exact same thread+recursion-depth could pop a stale (wrong) slot.
 * Nothing here has any evidence of throwing in the normal per-frame image
 * path, but this is exactly the sort of thing to watch for in a live log
 * (an exit log entry whose `entry_hook_id` doesn't match what you'd
 * expect) rather than assume can't happen.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SAFER THAN HAND-ROLLING THE TRAMPOLINE TOO
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * The one part of this whole design that genuinely requires knowing x86
 * instruction lengths well enough to relocate a prologue -- i.e. finding
 * how many bytes of the target's real prologue can be safely copied out
 * before overwriting them with a jump, without splitting an instruction in
 * half -- is entirely MinHook's job (via its vendored HDE disassembler),
 * not this file's. That's the whole point of vendoring MinHook rather than
 * hand-rolling that specific, failure-prone part: it's a small, widely
 * used, actively-maintained engine, not a one-off implementation with 23
 * different real prologues to get right on the first try against
 * irreplaceable hardware.

 * Bumped 30->31 (docs/74 §76, v24): one new PakonIMAu.dll hook
 * (sba_order_fpo_helper, 0x1028ae00) appended at the END of table[], same
 * append-only discipline. Thunk_30 added to hookstub.S and to

 *
 * The v41-v45 working tree inserted four hooks into the MIDDLE of
 * hookcore_real_table.c's table[] (shift_lut_builder, analyze_post_balance,
 * scp_lut_worker, tlb_lut_apply) without bumping this number. table[] is
 * declared `HookDef table[HOOKCORE_MAX_HOOKS]`, so 36 initialisers into a
 * 32-element array is only a WARNING in C ("excess elements in array
 * initializer", emitted four times by this repo's own build.sh and not
 * treated as an error) -- the last four entries were silently DISCARDED at
 * compile time:
 *
 *     color_adjust_shift  0x101b76d0    sba_order_fpo_calc    0x1028b8d0
 *     sba_order_fpo_helper 0x1028ae00   sba_vm_interp         0x102aadf0
 *
 * check_table_sync.py did not catch it because it compares SOURCE TEXT
 * against agent.js and never looks at HOOKCORE_MAX_HOOKS; a count check
 * against this constant is added there in the same pass. table[] is also
 * changed to an unsized `table[]` plus a compile-time assert, so an
 * over-long table can never again be silently truncated -- it becomes a
 * build failure instead.
 *
 * 40 rather than 36 leaves four spare slots so the next append does not
 * have to touch hookstub.S; Thunk_32..39 are defined there in this same
 * pass, per the Thunk_23 discipline documented in hookcore_real_table.c. */

                                     technique works (see this header's own
                                     top comment): it assumes the DWORD
                                     sitting at [esp] the instant a hooked
                                     address is reached is always a genuine
                                     return address pushed by a real `call`
                                     instruction, and unconditionally
                                     overwrites that stack slot with

                                     than `call` -- straight-line

                                     that assumption is false: [esp] holds

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OPT-IN, PER-HOOK "ALSO DUMP FULL BUFFER CONTENTS" EXTENSION (docs/74
 * SS47) -- layered ON TOP of the existing generic stack_dwords dump, not
 * a replacement for it. Motivation: for area_image_apply_lut specifically
 * (docs/74 SS46/SS47), the 3 LUT-pointer stack_dwords (indices 1/2/3,
 * confirmed docs/74 SS47.1's own re-derivation of the calling convention)
 * point at real, small (4096 entries x int16 = 8192 bytes each) buffers
 * whose CONTENTS -- not just their addresses -- had never been captured.
 * Deliberately kept OUT of HookDef itself (not a new positional field
 * threaded through all 25 existing table-literal entries in
 * hookcore_real_table.c) precisely because it is hook_id-specific,
 * optional, and small -- same spirit as hooks.cfg being a separate
 * overlay rather than a HookDef field, so adding it cannot silently
 * shift any existing entry's fields the way the Thunk_23 bug (SS46.8)
 * already showed a positional-array insertion can. Bounded at
 * HOOKCORE_EXTRA_DUMP_MAX_BYTES per row specifically so this stays a
 * small, cheap addition on the real box (worst case for
 * area_image_apply_lut: 3 x 8192 + 1 x 256 bytes per CALL, not per
 * pixel -- nothing like the per-pixel volume hotPathDisabled guards
 * against). Every row is IsBadReadPtr-guarded exactly like the existing
 * stack_dwords dump; an unreadable pointer logs `"readable":false`
 * rather than skipping the row silently or crashing.
 * Bumped 8192 -> 0x84000 (540672 = 132 pages, docs/74 SS60, 2026-08-16):
 * the full 245x367 planar/interleaved frame is 539490 bytes (=0x83B62), so
 * the old cap only carried ~2-16 scanlines, which is not enough to solve
 * the raw<->RPD12 spatial relayout by 2D cross-correlation (the two
 * buffers are laid out differently and the truncated tops don't overlap).
 * 0x84000 is the page-rounded committed size of that buffer (539490 rounds
 * up to 132*4096); the first v12 build used 0x90000 (the observed inter-
 * buffer stride) and every full-frame dump came back IsBadReadPtr-failed,
 * so 0x84000 is the read-safe ceiling. LogExtraDumps' line buffer moved to
 * the heap at the same time because 0x84000*2 hex chars exceeds the
 * default 1 MB thread stack. */

/* v46 -- WHEN a row fires. Until v46 every row fired on ENTRY only, because

 * of in-place transforms (PolyPixel is in-place; area_image_apply_lut rewrites
 * this->0x20 in place; the shift-LUT builder writes through out-pointers), so
 * "the buffer at the boundary" only exists after the call returns. Entry-only
 * gave inputs and nothing else, and the whole reason a reference trace was
 * asked for is to have BOTH sides of each stage on the same frame.
 *
 * HOW THE EXIT DUMP READS ITS POINTERS -- and why it does NOT re-read the
 * stack. At the instant OnReturnThunk runs, the hooked function's own
 * `ret`/`ret N` has already executed. For a cdecl callee (`ret`) ESP still
 * points at the argument block, but for a stdcall/thiscall callee (`ret N`)
 * ESP is N bytes ABOVE it -- and OnReturnThunk's own prologue plus LogExitC's
 * ~700-byte frame are written BELOW that ESP, i.e. straight through the
 * argument block. Re-reading argsPtr at exit would therefore hand back this
 * harness's own stack garbage for every stdcall/thiscall hook, silently, and
 * this engine is deliberately calling-convention-agnostic so there is no
 * per-hook way to know which is which.
 *
 * Instead, HookEntryC SNAPSHOTS the stack dwords and ECX into the shadow-stack
 * frame at entry, and the exit dump resolves its pointers from that snapshot.
 * The pointer VALUES are the entry-time ones (correct: they are the caller's
 * arguments, which the callee cannot change) and the BUFFER CONTENTS are the
 * exit-time ones (which is the point). The buffers live in the heap, so
 * nothing OnReturnThunk does can touch them.
 *
 * An EXIT/BOTH row only fires when this call was actually exit-hooked -- i.e.
 * `wantExitDefault`/hooks.cfg enabled it AND LooksLikeCodeAddress accepted the
 * return-address swap AND the shadow stack had room. If any of those declined,
 * the ENTRY half still lands and the EXIT half is simply absent; it never
 * degrades into a wrong reading. */

                                     count, is what kills a capture, and the
                                     two failures that cost real scans were
                                     both volume or index errors on a hot
                                     function: v45 hung ~96 KB of dumps on
                                     tlb_lut_apply, which fires 52,877 times
                                     in one scan (~5 GB), and the log was
                                     truncated to uselessness. Before v46 the
                                     only lever was all-or-nothing -- either
                                     the hot function carried its big dump on
                                     every call, or it carried none.

                                     That is exactly backwards for a trace:
                                     the interesting content of a hot function
                                     is the FIRST few calls (the first frames),
                                     and everything after is the same shape
                                     again. A per-row cap turns "impossible"
                                     into "N frames", and it is what makes the
                                     0x84000 full-frame rows affordable at all
                                     (39 frames x 2 planes x 0.5 MB, hex-
                                     encoded, is ~160 MB from ONE row).

                                     ENTRY and EXIT halves of a BOTH row share
                                     one counter, so `maxDumps = 2*N` gives N
                                     matched pairs; ENTRY-only and EXIT-only
                                     rows on the same hook count separately.

                                     A capped row that has stopped emits
