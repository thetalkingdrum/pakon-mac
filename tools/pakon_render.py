"""Parametric per-frame render engine for the Pakon scanning application.

One image per frame. Nothing on this path writes a file the user keeps —
frames are rendered from (capture + parameters) on demand, in memory, and
handed straight to the UI. Only ``export_frame`` writes, and only where the
user asked.

FIDELITY RULE
-------------
The image path adds **nothing** of its own. Every operation here is either a
call into ``pakon_decode`` / ``pakon_ansel`` / ``pakon_color``, or geometry
(rotate / flip / crop) which selects pixels without altering their values.
There is no tone curve, no saturation, no sharpening, no percentile stretch
and no white balance in this file — see ``UNAVAILABLE_CONTROLS`` for the
controls that were dropped for exactly that reason.

``render_frame(..., scale="full")`` with default parameters is intended to be
**byte-for-byte identical** to the corresponding ``frames/NN_srgb.png`` from
``pakon_decode.py strip --color --icc --frames``. ``pakon_render.py verify``
proves it on a real capture and prints the differing pixel count.

What that does and does not establish:

  verified here   the UI introduces zero deviation from the owned pipeline.
  NOT verified    that the owned pipeline equals Kodak's. The Ansel stage is
                  documented by its own authors as a stand-in
                  (``SETSHIFTS_12_PORTED = False``, "full AnsOrder/pcode is
                  NOT ported" — pakon_decode's docstring). Byte equality with
                  PSI/TLB cannot be claimed until that lands, and this module
                  must not be read as claiming it.

Ownership: this module *calls* the colour work in ``tools/pakon_decode.py``
and ``tools/ansel/`` — it does not modify or duplicate it. Stage 2 follows
``Roll.model`` (default ``f135`` = TLB 3×10 poly; ``f235`` = TLA LUT+3×4):

  * ``_rpd16`` (f135) — ``pakon_color.poly_hwc`` (TLB.dll @ 0x1000d880). The
    poly carries its own c9 pedestals; the Auto offset column is unused.
  * ``_rpd16`` (f235) — LUT + 3×4 with an explicit offset column so the UI can
    hold *roll* Dmin fixed while one frame's offsets move (docs/11 §5).
  * ``roll_offsets_from_hist`` — f235 only; f135 returns ``[0,0,0]``.

Pipeline per frame (docs/58; F-135 default):

    capture .bin
      → segment_lines → to_rgb14                     (once, cached as memmap)
      → apply_unit_calibration                       (per frame slice)
      → density LUT + 3x4 matrix + roll offsets + user offsets   → RPD 12-bit
      → AnselEngine.render_scene(roll_scale)         → toned
      → AnselEngine.to_srgb                          → sRGB u8
      → transport unsquash + rot90                   → square pixels
      → user geometry / tone / sharpening            → display or file

Measured on this repo's captures (Apple silicon, 2026-08-07), by
``pakon_render.py check`` on captures/test_nofifo.bin — 694.8 MB, 57 900
lines, 47 frames. Median of nine renders after one warm-up call:

    open capture ........................ ~26 s     (once per roll)
      reading + segmenting + unpacking ...   4.9 s
      caching the rgb14 memmap ..........    1.2 s
      roll histogram and boundaries .....    5.4 s
      per-frame scene balance ...........   20.4 s   <- dominates
    thumb     361 x 250  (1/8) ..........   12 ms
    preview   720 x 500  (1/4) ..........   39 ms
    display  1439 x 1000 (1/2) ..........  147 ms
    full     2878 x 2000 (1/1) ..........  630 ms

Two things follow, and the UI is built on both. A drag runs on the preview
path and settles to *display*, not to full: 39 ms is inside a drag budget and
147 ms is not perceptible on release, whereas 630 ms is. Full quality is an
export-only path and is never rendered interactively.

And an open is 26 seconds, not the 3.5 s this docstring claimed until
2026-08-07 — an error of about 7x that had propagated into the UI as well.
Nearly all of it is the per-frame Ansel scene balance (~0.43 s x 47 frames);
decoding 694 MB is only about 6 s of it. That is why opening shows a real
progress bar with a phase name rather than a spinner.

    ``film_base`` overrides the FindDmin measurement below with an explicit
    R,G,B triple. Use it when the frame is fully photographic content with no

    bright real subject (sunlit glass, snow, sky) that FindDmin cannot tell
    apart from clear film, and will anchor the whole inversion on the wrong
    thing. A known-good base from another frame of the same roll/stock (or a
    real vendor measurement) is more trustworthy than a guess made from this
    frame's own content.

    Unlike a .bin, this is already one extracted, geometry-corrected frame

    WHY THE CASCADE AND NOT ``dec.find_frames``
    -------------------------------------------
    ``dec.find_frames`` is one brightness-gap pass and its own comment says so.
    Kodak runs five passes and *records which one placed each frame*, because
    the placements are not equally trustworthy and the operator is expected to
    check the weak ones. Its last resort, ``FramingBlindlyPlacePictures``,
    gives up on detection entirely and spaces frames evenly — so wrong
    boundaries are a designed-for outcome here, not an edge case. Carrying the
    phase through to the UI is the whole point: without it every boundary
    looks equally confident and the operator has no idea where to look.

    Order matters. The transport scale wants the measured frame pitch, and the
    pitch comes out of framing, so framing runs first — and framing itself
    prefers its own measurement to the geometry (see
    ``pakon_framing.estimate_pitch``), which makes the dependency one-way.

#: Which (format, colour) pairs can honestly carry more than 8 bits.
#:
#: The default sRGB path ends in the vendor-matched ICC evaluator
#: (``kcmsclut.EvalU8`` / ``pakon_kcms_clut.evaluate``), whose own captured
#: output table is 8-bit — that is the real vendor CMM's own ceiling, not a
#: quantisation this port chose. Writing IT into a 16-bit container by
#: replicating bytes would advertise depth that does not exist.
#:
#: "srgb16" is different: it is ``kcmsclut.EvalU16`` (docs: its own
#: docstring), which blends between the SAME real captured vendor bytes
#: instead of floor-snapping to one, giving a genuinely smoother — not
#: independently vendor-verified above 8 bits, but not invented either —
#: 16-bit result. See docs/74 (16-bit sRGB export) for the full reasoning.
#:
#: "linear" is a third, unrelated thing: the pre-tone/pre-ICC RPD16 stage-2
#: output, genuinely 16-bit all the way through this port's own pipeline. Not
#: a claim that the real vendor software ever wrote a 16-bit file of its own
#: — it measurably did not, even on this stage (see the "Save As Raw" comment
#: in ``export_frame`` below for the real vendor file this was checked
#: against).

#: What to do when the file an export would write already exists.
#:
#: There used to be no such policy: export opened the path and wrote. A second
#: export of the same roll silently replaced the first, and — worse, because it
#: is invisible in the destination folder — any two frames whose template
#: renders to the same name overwrote each other *within a single export*, so a
#: 24-frame roll could quietly produce one file.
#:
#: "overwrite" stays available because replacing your own earlier export after
#: a re-grade is a real and common intention. It is just no longer the only
#: behaviour, and never the unasked-for one: the app plans the whole export
#: first, and will not start one that would destroy a file without being told
#: which of these to do.
