"""The colour engine boundary: Python's frame data into Go, sRGB back.

This is phase 2 of docs/62. The app renders through Go now. Everything from
the stage-2 polynomial onward — the F-135 inversion, SBA/balance, Shasta,
FUGC, the ICC hop — lives in ``tools/ansel/pipeline`` and is reached from here
through a c-shared dylib loaded by ctypes.

WHAT CROSSES, AND WHAT DOES NOT
-------------------------------
Python keeps capture, sync/unpack, per-pixel dark x gain, CCD deskew, framing
and frame slicing, transport geometry, and every piece of metadata handling —
the sidecar, the transport scale, the pitch measurement, DX resolution, and
the refusals at the front door. Go keeps the colour chain.

What crosses is the calibrated **14-bit frame slice on the capture's own
grid**, before ``unsquash_transport`` and before ``rot90``, as a contiguous
``(h, w, 3)`` uint16 buffer, and an ``(h, w, 3)`` uint8 buffer comes back. One
image per frame, no intermediates, nothing written to disk in either
direction: the dylib is structurally unable to write a file and structurally
unable to resample (there is no scale on the call and the output is the same
h x w as the input).

WHY A DYLIB
-----------
docs/62 §3.2 measured the three options on this machine. A ctypes call into Go
costs **2.8 us**; a process spawn costs **6.6 ms** and a framed round-trip over
pipes a further **16 ms at display size and 54 ms at full**, per render, every
render. Re-rendering to move a slider has to stay interactive, so the transport
had to cost nothing. The repo already loads two shared libraries exactly this
way (``pakon_color._LIB_C``, ``pakon_sba_apply._LIB_ANSEL``), so this is the
existing architecture rather than a new one.

The cost, stated plainly and not mitigated away: Go now shares a crash domain
with the backend. ``cabi.go`` recovers panics at every exported entry point and
returns them as errors, but that is a review discipline, not a compiler
guarantee. If it ever proves insufficient the same JSON request/response moves
onto a pipe without changing this module's interface.

ERRORS ARE DATA
---------------
Go refuses rather than guesses — no film base, no film class, no stock — and
those refusals have to reach the operator as readable text. Nothing here parses
stderr and nothing infers meaning from an exit status: every call returns a
code and a JSON object, and this module raises it as ``GoColourError`` with
``.kind`` and ``.message``. ``tools/pakon_app.py`` turns that into the JSON
body ``app/src/api.js:frameError`` already knows how to display.

NO SILENT FALLBACK
------------------
``pakon_color.py`` degrades to numpy without a word when its dylib is missing,
and ``docs/62`` §10 risk 5 names that as the same failure shape as the missing
inversion: you cannot tell from the output which engine produced it. This
module raises instead. If the dylib is absent, stale, or does not match
``tools/native-manifest.json``, you get an exception naming the file and the
build command — never a quietly different image.
