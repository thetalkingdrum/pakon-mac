WHAT THIS IS GUARDING AGAINST
=============================
An overnight roll scan ran seven minutes. The lamp died about two minutes in
and the transport kept running for five more with the sensor reading darkness.
Nothing was watching the lamp, and the roll-end detector tested one boundary
("bright enough to be a clear gate"), so darkness read as film present.

Six independent things now have to fail before that can happen again:

  0. THE MACHINE'S OWN FILM SENSORS. Every DX packet reports whether film is
     at the entry and exit sensors, and ``hardware_cb = 0xC0000000`` has been
     in every sidecar this project ever wrote while nothing read it. They are
     now the *primary* end-of-roll signal: sustained clear after film has been
     seen ends the roll, and film still present vetoes an optical roll-end —
     which is what stops a scan ending on the leader. See ``FilmSense``. They
     never veto the DARK stop.

  1. THREE-STATE CLASSIFICATION (``pakon_gate``). Every window is CLEAR, FILM
     or DARK, from levels derived out of ``calibration/``. DARK stops the motor
     within ~0.5 s. Regression-tested against ``captures/roll.bin``, which is
     the real lamp failure: it is flagged DARK 29.9 % in, where the lamp died.

  2. LAMP HEALTH POLLED DURING THE SCAN. Light-board ``0x83`` status and
     ``0x88`` temperatures, once a second, aborting on fault bits 5 and 6
     (docs/40 s12). The vendor does *not* do this — ``LAMP_WARNING`` and
     ``LAMP_ERROR`` are consumed but never produced anywhere in TLB.dll
     (docs/53 s4.5) — so this is new work, not parity. If the poll itself stops
     working we abort too, because "nothing was watching the lamp" is the exact
     failure being fixed.

  3. A HARD TIME LIMIT, ALWAYS. It stops the motor regardless of what any
     detector believes. A 36-exposure roll runs about four minutes, so the
     default is six and the ceiling is fifteen. There is no "unlimited".

  4. STOP ON EVERY EXIT PATH. ``safe_stop`` runs from ``finally``, from the
     signal handlers, from the parent when the child dies, and from the child
     when the parent dies. See THE DYING-PROCESS PROBLEM below.

  5. CANCEL THAT CANCELS. Closing the control pipe, a SIGTERM, or
     ``pakon_scan.py stop`` each halt the transport inside a second. The gap
     list found an export Cancel that was enabled and did nothing; this one is
     tested by killing the process mid-run.


THE DYING-PROCESS PROBLEM
=========================
If a process holding the USB interface is SIGKILLed, no Python runs, so no
``finally`` fires and no stop packet is sent — while the film keeps moving.
Hoping this does not happen is not a design, so both directions are handled:

  * The scan always runs in its own process. The application backend holds no
    USB handle at all, so the interface is free the instant the scan process
    dies for any reason.

  * PARENT DIES -> the child notices. The parent holds the write end of the
    child's stdin. When the parent exits, however violently, that pipe reaches
    EOF; the child's watchdog thread is blocked on exactly that read, and an
    EOF is treated as a cancel. This works for SIGKILL, for a crash, and for
    the user force-quitting the app.

  * CHILD DIES -> the parent notices. If the scan process exits without having
    reported a confirmed stop, the parent opens the device itself and sends
    motor-stop and lamp-off. The kernel released the interface when the child
    died, so this can actually get through.

  * BOTH DIE -> the next process to start cleans up. The child writes a marker
    file while a scan is in flight and removes it on a confirmed stop. A stale
    marker means a scan was interrupted without a stop being confirmed, and
    ``check_stale`` will send one. ``pakon_app`` calls this at startup.

  * And the child holds its own deadline, so an orphan still stops on time.


THE THREE NUMBERS THAT ARE ONE SETTING
======================================
FPGA integration 4093, lamp PWM N 982, light-board 0x91 speed 60. They are a
single exposure setting spread across three registers: N = trunc(4093 x 0.24)
and the 0x91 rate follows from the same exposure. Change one and all three must
be recomputed, and the committed dark/gain tables stop being valid. So they are
read from ``calibration/README.json`` — the record of what the tables were
captured at — and are not exposed as settings.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The DX board's auto-off, and what to do about it
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE MECHANISM IS DECODED. docs/57 section 6 disassembles it out of the DX
# board's PIC16F877: a 32-bit counter loaded with 0x0002FAF1 = 195 313 Timer0
# overflows, decremented once per overflow, switching off RC1 and RB0 when it
# reaches zero. At the 20 MHz clock docs/57 section 2.1 pins exactly, that is
# 10.0000 s. Command 0x98 (handler 0x0DC6) clears the arm bit outright, so a
# single packet ends it -- no refreshing. Command 0x08 puts it back.
#
# THREE REASONS NOT TO SIMPLY REPLACE THE REFRESH WITH IT:
#
#   1. 0x98 has never been sent to this machine. The mechanism is read, not
#      observed.
#   2. Nothing in the firmware names a pin. Whether RC1/RB0 drive the DX
#      emitters, the main scanning lamp or both is UNKNOWN (docs/57 sections
#      6, 9, 12). Our 20 s refresh writes the *light board's* 0x80/0x81/0x82,
#      which are a different set of registers; if those are the main lamp and
#      RC1/RB0 are not, then 0x98 will disarm a timer that was never the
#      problem and the lamp will die anyway.
#   3. The failure we are actually chasing does not fit. captures/roll.bin's
#      lamp died about two minutes in, not at ten seconds -- so either
#      something was already kicking this timer, or that failure is a
#      different one. docs/59 lists it as an open question, and it is.
#
# Against that, the refresh is the one thing that has been *measured*: 120 s
# stable with it, ~60 s without. So the default keeps it, and 0x98 is sent
# alongside as the decoded mechanism it is.
#
#   auto      send 0x98 once at scan start AND keep refreshing. The superset.
#             Costs one extra packet per scan and cannot be worse than today.
#   command   send 0x98 at start and again every refresh interval, INSTEAD of
#             the 0x81/0x82/0x80 triple -- but fall back to the refresh, for
#             the rest of the scan, the first time the board declines it. This
#             is the mode that tests the decoded mechanism without betting a
#             roll of the owner's film on it.
#   refresh   0x98 is never sent. Exactly the behaviour before this existed.
#   off       neither. The control, for reproducing the failure deliberately.

    """Re-assert the lamp drive mid-scan, without ever turning it off.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. The lamp has now died at roughly sixty seconds, twice, at
    the same point, which caps every scan at about a minute. The leading
    hypothesis is a light-board safety timeout that expects the host to keep
    saying the lamp should be on.

    The evidence is a detail that never made sense as initialisation:
    ``FN_bBeforeScan`` calls ``LampOn`` **twice, a second apart**. A second
    ``FN_bDrvLampOn`` with an unchanged mask does not rewrite ``0x80`` — the
    mask is cached host-side and skipped (docs/40 s12) — so what the vendor's
    second call actually puts on the wire is ``0x81`` and ``0x82`` again, with
    identical values. As re-initialisation that is a no-op. As a watchdog kick
    it is not.

    So this sends the same bytes the vendor's second call does, plus the enable
    mask, because we do not yet know which of the two the board counts:

      ``full``    0x82 PWM, 0x81 levels, 0x80 mask — a superset, the default,
                  because the point is to settle the hypothesis in one run
      ``drive``   0x82 and 0x81 only — exactly the vendor's second LampOn
      ``enable``  0x80 only — the narrowest reading of the hypothesis
      ``off``     nothing, to reproduce the failure as a control

    What it never does is send ``0x80 = 0``. The lamp is not cycled: the proven
    bring-up order starts with an off, and doing that here would put a black
    band through the middle of the owner's roll.

    Values come from ``cfg``, so a refresh cannot drift the exposure away from
    the one the committed calibration is valid for. That includes the BnW/
    ColNeg duty split (docs/75, ``ScanConfig.film_on_counts``): this reasserts
    whatever duty the scan is actually running at, via ``cfg.film_on_counts``,
    not the bare ``cfg.on_counts`` -- otherwise a periodic refresh on a BnW
    roll would silently revert the lamp to the colour-negative-tuned duty
    every ``--lamp-refresh`` interval, defeating the switch
    ``lamp_switch_to_scan_duty`` just made.

#
# THE BITS HAVE BEEN ARRIVING ALL ALONG. Every DX packet's first record carries
# a status nibble, and hardware_cb = 0xC0000000 -- film sensed at entry AND at
# exit -- is in every scan sidecar this project has taken. Nothing read it.
#
# Meanwhile the optical end-of-roll detector has been wrong twice: once it read
# a dead lamp as film, once it stopped on the leader. Both are inferences from
# image brightness about a question the transport answers directly.
#
# So the sensors become the primary signal, in the two directions that are
# actually safe:
#
#   * film sensed, then sustained-clear  ->  the roll has ended. Stop.
#   * film sensed and still present      ->  VETO an optical roll-end. This is
#                                            the "stopped on the leader" bug,
#                                            and the veto is exactly what
#                                            prevents it.
#
# and in the direction that is not safe, it does nothing:
#
#   * the DARK stop is never vetoed. Film present plus a dark sensor is a lamp
#     that has died with the owner's film in the gate, which is the failure
#     this whole module exists for. docs/53 s4.5 records that the vendor would
#     have neither aborted nor warned; we abort.
#
# LIMITS, STATED PLAINLY. The status nibble only exists on packets that carry
# at least one record (the board ORs it into record 0's type byte and nowhere
# else, docs/57 s8.2). So when events stop arriving the sensors stop being
# readable, and a stale reading must not be allowed to veto anything -- hence
# FILM_SENSE_STALE_S. "Events stopped arriving" is itself a plausible
# end-of-roll signal (docs/57 s7.3 suggests counting lines since the last
# perforation) but that needs a lines-per-mm figure this file does not have,
# so it is not implemented and not pretended to be.

#: Both sensors must read clear for this long, continuously, before the roll is
#: called ended. Film presence does not flicker with image content the way the
#: optical detector's CLEAR does, so this can be far shorter than
#: ``gate.ROLL_END_LINES`` -- but it is long enough that a single mis-read
#: packet cannot end a roll. INFERRED: no vendor value corresponds to it.
FILM_SENSE_CLEAR_S = 2.0

#: After this long without a readable status nibble, the film sensors have no
#: current opinion: they cannot end a roll and they cannot veto the optical
#: detector. Without this, a DX board that went quiet while film was present
#: would veto every optical roll-end for the rest of the scan.

    The vendor polls the same two things from ``FN_bDrvGetHardwareStatusLamp``

    why the overnight failure went unnoticed for five minutes. This is called
    once a second, inline in the capture loop.

    Inline, deliberately. A second thread doing USB while the bulk reads run
    would be faster, but the one hard-won lesson of this capture path is that
    interfering with the stream mid-loop destroys it (docs/45), and a control
    round trip once a second is 0.3 % of the loop's time. Correctness over
    throughput, in the code whose job is to stop things.

    THE FAILURE COUNTER FOLLOWS ``0x83`` ALONE. It used to advance only when
    *both* reads failed, so a board that stopped answering the status register
    while its temperatures still came back was treated as a healthy poll: the
    counter reset, the previous status byte stayed in ``h.status``, and it was
    republished every second as a current reading. That is being blind to fault
    bits 5 and 6 -- the primary lamp-failure detector, and the only direct

    background and what is/is not reused from ``calib_wizard``/
    ``build_calibration``.

    ***REQUIRES THE LAMP OFF WHEN CALLED.*** This measures the sensor's own
    dark level; with the lamp on it would converge the offset register to
    whatever level reaches the sensor with the lamp lit, not a true black
    point. The caller is responsible for this -- ``run_scan``'s
    ``--live-afe-converge`` wiring calls it immediately after
    ``link.clear_fault()`` and before ``lamp_on`` is ever reached, which is
    the only place in this module that is known to satisfy it.

    ***NOT WIRED INTO ``ccd_configure`` OR THE DEFAULT SCAN PATH.*** A scan
    run without ``--live-afe-converge`` behaves exactly as it always has:
    ``ccd_configure`` still writes the single stored ``cfg.afe_offsets``.

    ***THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN EXERCISED END TO END AGAINST REAL HARDWARE.***
    Every primitive it calls (``ccd_configure``, ``reset_fifos``,
    ``acquire``, ``link.read_image``, ``pakon_gate.find_phase``/
    ``split_lines``, ``build_calibration.solve_offset``) is one this project
    already relies on elsewhere; the LOOP -- write probe, read back, decide,
    repeat -- is new and has only been checked with synthetic measurement
    data (see the logic-only test alongside this change). Run it once,
    supervised, watching the printed per-round black levels, before trusting
    it unattended on a real scan. See docs/74 for the write-up.

    Method, modelled on docs/55's own captured shape:
      1. Start at ``seed`` -- the vendor's own +10, +10, +10.
      2. Take a short, stationary (transport never moves), lamp-off probe at
         the current guess (:func:`_live_afe_measure`).
      3. If the measured black level lands inside
         ``build_calibration.BLACK_MIN_WIRE``/``BLACK_MAX_WIRE`` of
         ``target`` and is not floored, stop.
      4. Otherwise hand every probe measured so far to
         ``build_calibration.solve_offset`` -- the exact function
         ``calib_wizard.step_black`` already trusts on real hardware for
         this same register -- and take its answer if it is solvable.
      5. If it is not solvable yet (fewer than two distinct offsets measured,
         or a channel whose slope could not be measured), nudge every
         channel by a fixed step, the same blind first move
         ``calib_wizard.step_black`` makes.
      6. Bail out after ``max_rounds``. On the way out, leave the AFE
         register at the BEST measurement actually seen -- highest,
         least-floored, closest to target -- not at whatever the last blind
         guess happened to be, then raise :class:`ScanRefused` so a caller
         cannot mistake "gave up" for "converged". Nothing here silently
         proceeds with an offset it could not confirm.

    Returns the converged ``(R, G, B)`` offsets. Acquire is off on every

#:
#: THE OPERATOR'S. This was the one place in the system where the code and the
#: interface said opposite things — ``pakon_app.job_open`` preferred the typed
#: value, while the Scan screen told the user the board's reading "outranks it,
#: a measurement beats a typed setting". The code is right and the text was
#: changed, for two reasons that are both about this project rather than about
#: measurements in general:
#:
#:   * ``tools/dx_decode.py`` has never been validated against a real roll, so
#:     the board's "measurement" is an unvalidated decode of a barcode. It is
#:     evidence, not ground truth.
#:   * a typed DX is a deliberate statement about the roll physically in the
#:     gate. Silently substituting something else for it renders the owner's
#:     film as a stock they did not choose and tells them nothing.
#:
#: Neither value is thrown away: both go in the sidecar with a ``dx_source``
#: saying which was used, and a disagreement is recorded and surfaced.

    CALLED TWICE PER SCAN. The ``finally`` covers every exit that runs Python —
    abort, cancel, SIGTERM, SIGINT — and none that does not. The app's cancel
    escalates to ``proc.kill()`` five seconds after the SIGTERM, and a SIGKILL
    runs no ``finally``: that is exactly how ``strip_cal.bin`` came to exist

    END; see :func:`converge_afe_offsets`'s own docstring before opting in on
    an unattended scan.

    ``read_dx`` adds the DX poll to the capture loop: pure reads of light-board
    registers 0x02 and 0x90, logged raw beside the capture as ``.dx.jsonl``.
    It cannot abort a scan and cannot move anything; if it fails it is noted
    and the scan continues.

    leaves the lamp off, which necessarily means every window classifies DARK,

    what stops it. Do not use it to scan film: the capture will be black.

    ``lamp_watchdog`` chooses how the DX board's decoded 10 s auto-off is
    handled — see :data:`LAMP_WATCHDOG_MODES` for what each one sends and why
    the default is the one that does both.

    ``motor=False`` never sends TRANSPORT FORWARD: the CCD is armed and reads
    lines from whatever is already in the gate, unmoving, until max_bytes/
    max_seconds stops it. For calibration captures (dark reference, bright
    reference, duty-search probes) nothing about the measurement needs film to
    move -- they read a stationary field of view repeatedly, the same way
    FN_bCalibrateFindLedDutyCycle's own real search does (confirmed by
    tonight's disassembly: it re-measures the same CCD line, not a moving
    strip). safe_stop's own MOTOR STOP is unconditional and idempotent either
