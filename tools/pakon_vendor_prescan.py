"""Vendor pre-scan bring-up `f`, ported exactly from TLB.dll — pure functions.

md5 of the source binary: TLB.dll `193d9b2ce0a4b77ae9b78262bd06c0fc`
(F-135, `/Users/guy/pakon-windows-repair/COM-SERVER/TLB.dll`). Every constant
here was read out of that binary; every arithmetic rule was recovered by
tier-3 static `af`+`pdf` disassembly and cross-checked against the tier-2 live
captures docs/55 (CCD/AFE) and docs/59 (light board).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
PSI runs two adaptive loops during every scan's bring-up: the AFE dark-offset
convergence (docs/55 steps 19-34) and the LED duty / white-balance search
(docs/59). Each is a DETERMINISTIC function of (current register state, sensor
read-back): `next_write = f(state, reading)`. This module is `f`, and only `f`
— the exact update rules, the exact rounding, the 9-bit sign-magnitude
encoding, the convergence windows, the iteration caps.

WHAT THIS IS *NOT*
------------------
* It is NOT wired into `pakon_scan.run_scan`. Importing this module changes
  nothing about the default scan path (which replays stored calibration).
* It drives NO hardware and reads NO hardware. The read-backs are inputs the
  caller supplies. A real integration would feed it EP-0x86 line data.
* Its adaptive loops are NOT bit-exact-validated. docs/55 + docs/59 captured
  only the vendor's *writes* (they hooked `DeviceIoControl`); the *read-backs*
  that drove each step flow over `ReadFile`/EP 0x86 and were never captured.
  The `--selftest` below reproduces docs/55's nine offset WORDS bit-exact
  (that part is proven), and demonstrates forward *consistency* against docs/55's
  offset trajectory — a consistency demo, explicitly NOT a validation, because
  a single trajectory does not pin `f` (round 2 lands the sensor on its floor;
  many rules fit the same three writes).

GATING
------
Nothing here executes on import. A caller that wants the ported bring-up must
opt in with the env flag, e.g.::

    import os
    if os.environ.get("PAKON_VENDOR_PRESCAN") == "1":
        from pakon_vendor_prescan import ...

so `PAKON_VENDOR_PRESCAN` defaults OFF and the flag name is discoverable.

TIER: tier-3 static (TLB.dll `af`+`pdf`) + tier-2 docs/55/59. NOT hardware.
