r"""Real-DLL, full-frame, colour-chain harness -- docs/74 the ask that produced
this file: an end-to-end Unicorn run of the real ``PakonIMAu.dll`` colour
chain on a genuine captured frame, not a synthetic pattern or a crop.

WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND ISN'T
=============================
It is NEW, ADDITIVE code.  It does not modify any existing golden file --
every DLL-side call goes through ``pakon_autotone_assembled_golden``'s own
``build_dll``/``RealCapset``/``host_run``/``_diff_scalars``/``_diff_array``/
``shipped_contrast_params``, completely unchanged, the same way docs/74 §17
"adapted the existing harness's own functions, completely unmodified, to
real pixel data instead of synthetic patterns" -- this file does the same
thing again, on a full real frame instead of a crop, plus one further real
chain link (``balanceAreaImage``) that no prior pass ran under Unicorn.

TWO INDEPENDENT PIECES
========================
1. ``analyzeFugc`` (leaf pieces only, already verified elsewhere) through
   ``analyzeAutoTone`` (the full six-subsystem chain, ``0x100fb730``, run
   for real end to end) -- on a genuine captured frame's real post-FUGC
   RPD-12 array, extracted from the real, unmodified production path
   (``pakon_render.open_capture`` -> ``AnselEngine.render_scene``, the
   exact same code every render in this project takes; the post-FUGC array
   is captured by intercepting ``pakon_ansel.real_auto_tone`` at its own
   call boundary -- the function is called through unmodified, only its
   input argument is also recorded).  This directly extends docs/74 §17
   (which ran the same assembled harness on 48x48/400x400 crops) to a
   genuine full frame, and produces a genuine DLL-side ground-truth toned
   render to diff the Python port's own ``real_auto_tone()``/``to_srgb()``
   against on the SAME frame.

2. ``ColorNegativePath::balanceAreaImage`` (``0x10102b20``) -- the one
   stage docs/74 §22 left genuinely open ("whether ``balanceAreaImage``
   mutates the shared pixel buffer directly, in place, before ``cna``
   reads it").  This file makes a real, honest, bounded attempt to
   Unicorn-execute its real body against the real pixel buffer, watching
   every write to that buffer's address range directly rather than
   inferring mutation from static reading.  Its calling convention was
   derived fresh this pass from a live, tool-verified (not manually
   guessed) disassembly of the real driver call site
   (``fcn.10069490`` around ``0x10069835``-``0x10069859``, cross-checked
   against r2's own automatic variable/argument recovery for
   ``0x10102b20`` itself -- ``args: 0`` in r2's function-summary field, but
   a genuine ``var_8h`` at ``ebp+8``, i.e. r2 DID find the one real cdecl
   parameter, it just didn't relabel it ``arg_8h``) -- see the
   ``BalanceAreaImageCall`` class docstring below for the exact derivation
   and its own honestly-stated uncertainty.  If it faults on a call target
   this project has no existing characterization for, this file reports
   that fault verbatim and stops -- it does not stub around unknown vendor
   arithmetic to force a green result.

REAL DATA, REAL RULES
=======================
Uses a real capture already in this project's own cache
(``fresh-calibration-scan-20260814-065421.bin`` -- today's post-recalibration
test scan, already cited by ``pakon_ansel.py``'s own ``real_auto_tone``
neighbourhood comment).  Only aggregate percentile/statistical summaries are
printed anywhere in this file's output, per this project's rule against
describing ``captures/`` (or, here, the app cache's equivalent) contents at
the pixel level.

DLL: the same MD5-verified copy every docs/74 section already used
(``eea9dcf78ee21d4f7c515a6c2512242d``), re-checked at the top of ``main()``.

    """Fix a real harness bug found THIS pass, not in any existing golden
    file's own contents: ``pakon_autotone_shell_golden.Emu.call`` hard-codes
    ``uc.emu_start(va, RET_MAGIC, timeout=0, count=200_000_000)`` and never
    checks that EIP actually reached ``RET_MAGIC`` afterward.  Every existing
    golden's own scenarios are small enough (largest: 400x400 = 160,000
    pixels) that 200,000,000 emulated x86 instructions is always far more
    than ``cna``'s own real analysis needs, so this never mattered before.

    A genuine full real frame does need more: confirmed directly this pass
    -- a 1043x1043 real crop (1,087,849 px) needs ~16s of real Unicorn
    execution even once the cap is no longer the limit, and the full real
    frame (5,930,000 px) needs ~57s.  Both are comfortably above what
    200,000,000 instructions buys at this DLL's real per-pixel cost, so the
    OLD cap was silently truncating ``cna``'s own analysis mid-function on
    real full-scale frames.  Because Unicorn's ``emu_start`` returns
    normally (no exception) when its own ``count`` budget is exhausted,
    ``Emu.call`` (which never checks final EIP) reported success with
    whatever ``AnsStatus`` value happened to already be sitting at ``sret``
    -- which reads as OK because that memory starts zero-filled -- while
    every result the truncated code path never got to write (``cna``'s own
    ``ToneScaleLut``, and everything ``dra`` derives from it) stayed at
    its allocation-time zero fill.  This produced exactly the shape of
    "real divergence" an earlier draft of this file's own Stage 2 first
    reported: sane ``threshold``/``nEdgePixels`` (written early, before the
    budget ran out) alongside an all-zero ``ToneScaleLut``/``dra`` (written
    late, after it did) -- see docs/74 §24's own corrected account.

    Does NOT modify ``pakon_autotone_shell_golden.py`` on disk -- replaces
    the bound method on the (already-imported) class object at runtime, in
    this process only, the same class of fix as this file's own
    ``HEAP``/``HEAP_SZ`` relocation immediately below.  A genuinely fixed
    ``Emu.call`` belongs in that file eventually; this is a diagnostic-grade
    patch scoped to this new script, not a claim that the fix has landed
    upstream.

    """A real, bounded, honestly-scoped attempt to Unicorn-execute
    ``ColorNegativePath::balanceAreaImage`` (``0x10102b20``) for real.

    CALLING CONVENTION -- derived fresh this pass, from live tool output,
    not manual byte-counting alone
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    r2 (``aa; af @ 0x10102b20; afvj``) reports ``callconv: cdecl``,
    ``args: 0`` in its coarse summary, but its own per-variable list
    includes ``var_8h`` at ``{"base":"ebp","offset":8}`` -- the canonical
    cdecl slot for a function's first (and, per the summary, only) stack
    parameter.  Cross-checked directly: 13 separate reads of that exact
    slot appear throughout the function body (``grep -c var_8h`` on a full
    ``pdf`` dump), confirming it is read repeatedly as a real incoming
    value, not misclassified dead stack.

    At the real call site (driver ``fcn.10069490``, live ``pd`` at
    ``0x10069835``-``0x10069859``, re-run this pass, not taken from any
    prior doc's transcription):

        lea eax, [esi + 0x4ac]
        push eax                    ; rec[2] = &esi+0x4ac
        xor eax, eax
        mov al, byte [esi + 0x29]
        push eax                    ; rec[1] = zx(byte[esi+0x29])
        push ecx                    ; rec[0] = ecx (whatever the driver's
                                     ;   own inherited value is at this point)
        mov ecx, esp                ; ecx = &rec
        mov dword [ebp + 0xc], esp  ; the driver's OWN local slot now holds &rec
        push esi                    ; esi = the driver's own "this"
        call 0x10006880             ; see below
        lea ecx, [ebp + 0xc]
        push ecx                    ; the ONE real argument: &(driver local)
        call 0x10102b20
        add esp, 0x10

    ``0x10006880`` (disassembled in full this pass) is
    ``ret 4`` (one stack arg, ``arg_4h``) plus an implicit ``ecx`` "this":
    ``eax = *(arg_4h); *(ecx_this) = eax; if (eax) AddRef(eax+4)`` -- i.e.
    a generic "wrap a raw pointer read from ``*driverThis`` into a
    refcounted slot" helper, the same shape as the AddRef idiom
    (``0x100065e0``) already characterized elsewhere in this DLL.  It
    OVERWRITES ``rec[0]`` with ``*esi`` (a field of the driver object,
    AddRef'd) before ``balanceAreaImage`` ever runs.

    So the argument this class constructs is: a pointer to a driver-local
    slot, which itself points to a 3-dword record
    ``{*esi (AddRef'd), zx(esi+0x29), &esi+0x4ac}`` -- double indirection,
    matching what the callee's own body does with it (``mov esi, dword
    [var_8h]`` inside ``0x10102b20`` dereferences it exactly ONCE before
    using the result, at the "area capability not found" throw path,
    ``0x10102c0b``).

    WHAT IS HONESTLY *NOT* ESTABLISHED
    ------------------------------------
    * The real value of ``*esi`` (the driver's own field 0) and
      ``esi+0x29`` this pass has no independent citation for -- both are
      filled here from the ALREADY-BUILT ``RealCapset.holder`` object
      (a real vftable, big refcount, survives AddRef/Release -- the same
      object the assembled ``analyzeAutoTone`` harness already uses) and
      zero, respectively, flagged plainly as synthetic scaffolding, not
      derived vendor values.
    * ``&esi+0x4ac`` is passed here as a pointer into a small header
      modelled on the SAME image-descriptor layout ``cna``'s own
      ``acquire`` already uses (width@+0xc, height@+0x10, pixels@+0x20 --
      ``pakon_cna.PARAMS_AT``-adjacent convention) so real image bytes
      flow into whatever ``balanceAreaImage`` does with this field --
      this is a MODELLING CHOICE, not a confirmed struct layout for this
      specific offset; the field's real vendor shape at ``+0x4ac`` was
      not independently re-derived this pass.
    * Everything ``balanceAreaImage``'s own body does beyond the
      "capability not found" path at its very entry (its 1379-instruction,
      295-basic-block real body, calling into several targets --
      ``0x100dc060``, ``0x100d9340``, ``0x100dc390``, ``0x1021fec0``,
      ``0x100daac0``, ``0x100f8340`` -- this project has no existing
      characterization for) is NOT modelled here.  If execution reaches
      one of those and it needs real behaviour this harness cannot supply
      without guessing, ``run()`` reports the exact fault and stops --
      it does not stub around it.
