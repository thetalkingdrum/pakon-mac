// SETTLED from the binary: the vendor does NOT quantise to 8 bit before the

// (PakonIMAu.dll @ 0x100938c0) compares it against "U8" at 0x10093bd6 and
// feeds the result to the ImaDataType factory (0x10311600, case 0 = unsigned
// char, case 1 = short) for the OUTPUT plane; there is no input datatype
// field in the DPI reader's string table at all (0x1059128c…0x105912e0).
// ImaICCXForm::apply (0x102f8420) selects the KODAKCMS SpEvaluate datatype at
// 0x102f85f4…0x102f8692: u8 planes take Sp type 1, 16-bit planes take Sp type
// 4 with an explicit 0..4095 mode gated on the caller's max value being
// exactly 4096.0 (constant at 0x105a17e0), otherwise Sp type 5.

// constructor at 0x1016e680, loading 32767.0 from 0x1058fac0, which would
