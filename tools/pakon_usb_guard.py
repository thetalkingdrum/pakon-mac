"""Transport-level allow-list for every EEPROM/I2C control transfer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
This project already destroyed one EEPROM. ``backups/eeprom-i2c/README.md``
and ``tools/eeprom_repair.py`` record it:

    healthy (Kodak USB F135.bin)   c0 05 0f 35 f2 07 aa 04 02
    after a blind I2C write sweep  5c 05 0f 35 f2 07 aa 04

A sweep of blind writes across what were assumed to be board addresses -- but
were in fact I2C *device* addresses -- overwrote byte 0 of the FX2 boot
personality. ``0xC0`` is the format signature meaning "take VID/PID from this
EEPROM"; ``0x5C`` is not valid, so the scanner stopped identifying itself.

That was recoverable only because Kodak ships the exact replacement bytes
(``FirmwareLoader/Personalities/USB F135.bin``). **The other chip has no such
escape.**

The idea is borrowed from ``pablonavarrob/pakon-tlx-macos``, which puts its
safety in the transport rather than in each caller: on ``wIndex 0x1234`` only
known reads are allowed through, anything else is dropped and logged. That is
a guardrail; per-tool discipline is only a rule, and this repo has already
demonstrated the difference. ``tools/i2c_raw_scan.py`` and
``i2c_eeprom.hex.DANGEROUS-WRITES`` still sit in the same directory as the
read-only dumpers, and nothing structural stops the wrong one being run.

WHAT THIS MODULE ENFORCES
-------------------------
**No transfer routed through here can write EEPROM 0x52.**

Stated as what the code does, not as a claim about the hardware: this wrapper
refuses every write-direction request on the device-addressed path, for every
caller, with no override. What the *firmware* would do with a request that
never leaves here is not something this module can demonstrate, and the
docstring no longer pretends otherwise (see "LIMITS" below).

The two chips are not equally precious and the allow-list is built around
exactly that asymmetry:

* ``0x51`` -- FX2 boot personality. **Replaceable**: the vendor ships the
  bytes (``FirmwareLoader/Personalities/USB F135.bin``). Writing it is
  permitted, but only on the boot-personality path and only after an
  explicit, deliberate unlock.
* ``0x52`` -- the per-unit calibration written by the Calibration Wizard. It
  cannot be downloaded, derived, or recreated from any vendor file. **There is
  no unlock for writing it. Not a flag, not an argument, not an environment
  variable.**

  What is actually on it, per ``docs/69`` §4.1/§5.2 rather than from memory:
  the scanner serial (``u32`` at ``0x0F``), ``NegMatrix0..29`` and
  ``PosMatrix`` colour matrices, and -- named by the vendor's own registry
  copy -- ``MotorAdjust``, ``MotorAdjustDrag(_Ir)``, ``MotorSpeedPlus(_Ir)``
  and ``Offset`` per DPI base, ``StepperLens``/``StepperCCD``, and the
  per-mode lamp calibration. The part is **at least 4 Kbit** and the vendor
  keeps two copies of two sections, the highest byte touched being ``0xA24``
  (2596) -- so the "254 of 256 bytes" figure this docstring used to carry was
  wrong, inherited from the 256-byte-device reading ``docs/69`` §5.2 refutes.

THE REQUEST PATHS
-----------------
Recovered from ``TLB.dll`` (md5 ``193d9b2ce0a4b77ae9b78262bd06c0fc``)
``fcn.100160a0`` = ``FN_bEEPromRead``, and re-confirmed by disassembly when
this allow-list was reviewed:

1. **Device-addressed path** -- ``wIndex 0x1234``, and it takes *two*
   requests, not one::

       0x10016138  or eax, 0x50           ; 7-bit addr = 0x50 | index
       0x1001613b  shl eax, 1             ; 8-bit addr (0xA4 for device 2)
       0x10016147  mov byte [var_8h], 0xa2    ; WRITE -> data phase 0xA2
       0x1001614c  je 0x10016158
       0x1001614e  or dword [arg_24h], 1      ; READ  -> select wValue |= 1
       0x10016153  mov byte [var_8h], 0xa9    ; READ  -> data phase 0xA9

   so a chip is selected by ``bRequest 0xA4`` whose ``wValue`` is the 8-bit
   I2C address **with the direction in bit 0**, re-issued before every 32-byte
   chunk; the data phase is then ``0xA9``/``0xA2`` whose ``wValue`` is a flat
   byte offset -- *not* a device address.

   Reads (select with bit 0 set, then ``0xA9``): allowed.
   **Writes -- the even-``wValue`` select and every ``0xA2`` -- never allowed.**

2. **Boot-personality path** -- ``wValue = 0``, ``wIndex = 0``, used by
   ``eeprom_repair.py``. Reads allowed; writes allowed after
   ``unlock_boot_write``.

``0xA0`` (ANCHOR_LOAD_INTERNAL, the FX2 RAM-download route
``i2c_raw_scan.py`` uses to drive raw I2C) is denied: that is the mechanism
the original damage went through.

LIMITS -- what this does NOT yet cover
--------------------------------------
* ``pakon_load.Fx2.vendor_out`` calls ``dev.ctrl_transfer`` directly (line 84)
  to download the stage-1 loader over ``0xA0``. The three EEPROM tools all
  import it, so the ``0xA0`` denial here is a good default but does **not**
  yet close the route that did the original damage. Routing ``Fx2`` through
  this module would.
* Chip selection is firmware-held state (that is what the ``0xA4`` select
  *is*), so which chip a later boot-path request lands on could in principle
  depend on what was selected earlier in the same power cycle -- possibly by
  another process. This module cannot see other processes. Within one, it
  refuses a boot-path write while a non-boot chip was the last one selected.
* ``tools/i2c_raw_scan.py`` still opens its own transfers and bypasses this
  module entirely.
