"""Back up every EEPROM, using the stage-1 loader and the vendor's sequence.

This project has now got the parameters wrong TWICE, in opposite directions,
and both times the tool reported success.

1. `pakon_load.py` issued 0xA9 with wValue=0, wIndex=0 and treated the result
   as a "personality" blob. Not addressing any EEPROM.

2. This tool then sent 0xA9 with `((n | 0x50) << 1) | 1` in wValue and no
   chip select at all, believing that was what fcn.100160a0 does. Issue #50:
   run against a live F-135+, it returned 0xFF for 8192 of 8192 bytes, on both
   chips, with no error -- a bus-idle read written out as a backup file.

THE SEQUENCE THE VENDOR ACTUALLY USES (docs/69 §5.1, read from TLB.dll
md5 193d9b2ce0a4b77ae9b78262bd06c0fc, fcn.100160a0 -- disassembly, triage-tier
evidence, not yet run bit-exact against this project's own hardware):

    0x10016138  or eax, 0x50            ; 7-bit addr = 0x50 | index
    0x1001613b  shl eax, 1              ; 8-bit addr  -> 0xA4 for index 2
    0x1001614e  or dword [arg_24h], 1   ; READ sets bit 0 -> 0xA5
    0x10016153  mov byte [var_8h], 0xa9 ; then the data phase

so it is TWO requests per chunk, not one:

    select   bRequest 0xA4   wValue ((n|0x50)<<1)|1   wIndex 0x1234  len 0
    data     bRequest 0xA9   wValue = flat BYTE OFFSET wIndex 0x1234  <=32B

The select is re-issued before EVERY chunk (the loop at 0x10016164). `wValue`
on the data phase is a byte offset, NOT an address -- that was the whole of
bug 2.

WHAT IS SAVED. Nothing is written to the scanner, ever. A dump is only saved
if `pakon_eeprom_check.py` can verify at least one section header + CRC-32; a
read that addresses nothing now fails loudly instead of producing a file that
looks like a backup. Use --force to keep a failing read for diagnosis; it is
named .SUSPECT and is not a backup.

STATUS: the sequence is read from disassembly (docs/69 §5.1) -- triage-tier
evidence, not a bit-exact confirmation -- and matches a third-party live read
on another unit (issue #50), but has NOT yet been run against this project's
own scanner. The validation above is what makes that acceptable -- a wrong
read can no longer masquerade as a good one.

Run it with the scanner power-cycled and NOT yet loaded (04b4:8613).
